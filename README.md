# Bamazon

This Node.JS program lets customers make purchases from the command line. It has three unique apps: 

* Customer Mode
* Manager Mode
* Supervisor Mode

## Customer Mode

Customer mode is simply for making purchases. 

## Manager Mode

Managers have the authority to view all products for sale, or specifically the products with low inventory. They can also add inventory for existing listings, or add an entirely new product. 

## Supervisor Mode

Supervisors, the highest level users, have the ability to view product sales by department, create totally new departments, or view products by total revenue.
